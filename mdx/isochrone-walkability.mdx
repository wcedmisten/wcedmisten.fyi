## Walkability

Walkability is the quality of a neighborhood that allows pedestrians to accomplish everyday tasks like
collecting groceries, visiting restaurants, and attending doctor's appointments, all on foot.

There are many ways to measure walkability, including intersection density and 
by measuring the distance to urban amenities. The most notable metric for walkability is 
Walk Score, which is owned by Red Fin. They use a proprietary system for this metric,
but ultimately their methodology[^walk-score-methodology] is based on the distance to amenities,
similar to the one I will explore today.

## Isochrone maps

Isochrone maps are a way to visualize the area that could be reached from a starting point in a given time.
These distances appear as contours originating from the starting point, showing bands across which the travel 
time is equal.

</figure>

Isochrone maps may account for travel by different methods. E.g. travel by car is constrained to roads, and 
travel by foot is constrained (roughly) to sidewalks.

## Motivation

The main idea of this project is to examine how not just density, but also the structure of roads and sidewalks 
impact walkability. For instance, compare these two pedestrian isochrone maps showing the destinations possible
in 15 minutes of walking:

</figure>

Even though there are clearly fewer amenities near this rural area, the network structure of roads also prohibits
covering as much distance, not to mention the lack of sidewalks facilitating safe pedestrian travel.
The city block structure in Manhattan provides a 30% increase in the walkable area from the starting point,
compared to the rural area.

To construct isochrone maps, we'll be using a tool called [Valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla),
which is an open source routing engine. This tool operates on top of openstreetmap data, which is crowdsourced
by volunteers, but is generally quite thorough, especially in urban areas.

### Downloading the data

First I downloaded the openstreetmap data from Geofabrik,[^geofabrik] which graciously hosts up-to-date extracts of openstreetmap for download.

Initially I used an extract specifically for Virginia which was a modest size of 342 MB.
But after this code was tested, I ran imported the entire United States extract, which is 8.5 GB.

Then I copied the data to `data/data.osm.pbf`

### Setting up Valhalla and PostGIS

I used docker compose to manage Valhalla and PostGIS so that I didn't have to install it locally.

For Valhalla, this docker compose file just exposes port 8002 for the API in addition to some volume mounts for the run script and the OSM data.

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  valhalla:
    image: valhalla/valhalla:run-latest
    ports:
      - "8002:8002"
    volumes:
      - ./scripts:/scripts
      - ./data:/data
    entrypoint: /scripts/build_tiles.sh
```

Combined with a simple bash script to build the Valhalla tiles and run the server:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir /data/valhalla_tiles

if ! test -f "/data/valhalla.json"; then
    echo "Valhalla JSON not found. Creating config." 
    valhalla_build_config --mjolnir-tile-dir /data/valhalla_tiles --mjolnir-tile-extract /data/valhalla_tiles.tar --mjolnir-timezone /data/valhalla_tiles/timezones.sqlite --mjolnir-admin /data/valhalla_tiles/admins.sqlite > /data/valhalla.json
fi

if ! test -f "/data/valhalla_tiles/timezones.sqlite"; then
    echo "Valhalla tiles not found. Building now."
    valhalla_build_timezones > /data/valhalla_tiles/timezones.sqlite
    valhalla_build_tiles -c /data/valhalla.json /data/data.osm.pbf
fi

if ! test -f "/data/valhalla_tiles.tar"; then
    echo "Tile extract not found. Extracting now."
    valhalla_build_extract -c /data/valhalla.json -v
fi

echo "Starting valhalla server."
valhalla_service /data/valhalla.json 1
```

The full code can be found [here](https://github.com/wcedmisten/city-walkability).

## Setting up PostGIS

PostGIS is a geospatial extension on top of PostgreSQL, which does some very cool optimizations to support efficient geospatial queries.

Similarly, I set up PostGIS using my [osm2pgsql-docker repo](https://github.com/wcedmisten/osm2pgsql-docker)
and imported the US dataset with `osm2pgsql`, a tool used for ingesting the protobuf formatted data into PostGIS.

```yaml
version: "3.9"  # optional since v1.27.0
services:
  postgis:
    container_name: postgis
    image: postgis/postgis
    ports:
      - "15432:5432"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./postgresql.conf
        target: /etc/postgresql.conf
    command: ["postgres", "-c", "config_file=/etc/postgresql.conf"]
```

After PostGIS was running, I imported the data. This was initially tested on the Virginia state osm.pbf data,
but I later updated this to use the entire US dataset. After making this change, the script kept running out of memory.
So I added the `--slim --drop` flags, which process the data using PostgresSQL (using my SSD), rather than storing everything in memory.
Although I was running this on a 16 GB machine, I did not have enough free memory to process for the whole file.


```bash
PGPASSWORD=password osm2pgsql \
  --create \
  --verbose \
  -P 15432 -U postgres -H localhost \
  -S osm2pgsql.style \
  --slim --drop \
  /home/wcedmisten/Downloads/us-latest.osm.pbf
```

I also used a simplified version of `osm2pgsql.style` to reduce the number of features imported into 
the database.

These 3 lines were retained, but most other tags were set to be deleted, rather than imported.

```
node,way   amenity      text         polygon
node,way   shop         text         polygon
node,way   leisure      text         polygon
```

I intentionally limited my analysis to `amenity`, `shop`, and `leisure` tags.

Due to using my SSD instead of memory for the import, the whole process took around 6 hours. I just let it run overnight, 
so this wasn't a huge issue.

Even with this reduced set of tags, the database still took up 25 GB of storage, much more than could fit in memory.

## Writing the Code 

Now that the backends were set up, I could begin writing the code to measure walkability.
My code was intended to do several things for each city we want to measure:

* Sample some points randomly inside a city
* Find the isochrone map for each of these points within a 15 minute walk
* Find the amenities within this isochrone boundary (e.g. restaurants, parks, grocery stores, etc.)

### Getting the City Boundary Data

To find the boundaries for US cities, I downloaded a few different datasets for cities:

* geoJSON files for each city's boundary for major cities in the US. These were based on the TIGER US census dataset that someone converted to GeoJSON
* top 1,000 most populous cities. I examined the top 100 cities in this dataset to compare walkability.

I then created a PostGIS table, `city`, to store the GeoJSON boundaries for these 100 cities using a python script:

`upload_cities.py`:

```python
import psycopg2
import json

from util import get_cities

conn = psycopg2.connect(host="localhost", port="15432", dbname="postgres", user="postgres", password="password")
cur = conn.cursor()

create_city_table = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS city (
    name text,
    state text,
	geom geometry,
    PRIMARY KEY (name, state)
);
"""

cur.execute(create_city_table)
conn.commit()


def import_city(city, state):
    with open(f"geojson-us-city-boundaries/cities/{state}/{city}.json") as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    geom = data['features'][0]['geometry']

    cur.execute("INSERT INTO city (name, state, geom) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)", (city, state, json.dumps(geom)))
    conn.commit()


# get_cities() just munged the city population JSON data to get the top 100
for city, state in get_cities():
    # print(city,state)
    import_city(city, state)
```

This allowed me to query whether or not a point is inside a city with the SQL query:

```
SELECT ST_Contains(geom, ST_GeomFromText('POINT(%s %s)'))
    FROM ( SELECT geom FROM city WHERE name=%s AND state=%s ) as geom
```

### Sampling

I wanted to generate an even distribution of points across a city and sample "walkability" at each of these points.
Then, all samples could be averaged out.

To accomplish this, I calculated the bounding box for each city, and generated a Poisson disk sampling[^poisson-disk-sampling] of points.
This distribution guaranteed minimal overlap of points being sampled.

This bounding-box distribution for New York City looked like this:

![sampling points for bounding box of NYC - map data copyright openstreetmap](/isochrone-walkability/bbox.png)

After removing the points outside of the city's actual boundaries, the sample looked like this:

![sampling points for NYC](/isochrone-walkability/sampling-in-geom.png)

Zoomed in further:

![sampling points for NYC - zoomed in](/isochrone-walkability/sampling-zoomed.png)

Poisson disk distributions guarantee a minimum separation distance for all the points. I picked a 
distance somewhat arbitrarily that would have some overlap of walkable amenities for neighboring samples, but not too much.

The code to do this was also fairly simple, relying on a library `poisson_disc` [^poisson-disc-lib] to calculate the sample points,
and PostGIS to determine whether each point was in the city.

```python
get_bbox_query = """SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Envelope( geom ))
FROM ( SELECT geom FROM city WHERE name=%s AND state=%s ) as geom
"""

cur.execute(get_bbox_query, [city, state])
bbox = cur.fetchone()

minx, miny, maxx, maxy = shapely.wkt.loads(bbox[0]).bounds
height = (maxy - miny)
width = (maxx - minx)

points = poisson_disc.Bridson_sampling(dims=np.array([width,height]), radius=.005)

is_in_query = """
SELECT ST_Contains(geom, ST_GeomFromText('POINT(%s %s)'))
FROM ( SELECT geom FROM city WHERE name=%s AND state=%s ) as geom
"""

scaled = list(map(lambda p: [p[0] + minx, p[1] + miny], points))

def point_in_city(point):
    is_in_city = cur.execute(is_in_query, [point[0], point[1], city, state])
    return cur.fetchone()[0]

# get all the points in the given city
in_city = list(filter(point_in_city, scaled))
```

## Creating a metric 

Now that I had a sampling for the city, I needed a metric to calculate for each point.

I used a relatively simple approach: I examined a few categories of urban amenities and 
gave 1 point to each unique category of amenity within a 15 minute walking distance.
The walking distance was determined by querying Valhalla for each sampled point.

For instance, a point with 3 restaurants, 2 bakeries, and 1 shoe store within walking distance would 
get a score of 3: 1 point for each category. I reasoned that most amenities are essentially a 
binary category. Either the amenity you want is within walking distance or it's not. For future work, I 
would probably change this to a logarithmic or logistic function to reflect diminishing returns on amenities of the same category.

The first bakery within walking distance provides much more value than the second one, which provides more value 
than the third, etc.

It was also simpler to examine these categories at a binary level because the OSM data model has many 
places where a single entity would be represented as multiple nodes (i.e. a building polygon), and 
this approach avoided that complexity.

15 minutes was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, but 
is about the maximum I would consider to be a "quick walk" to a destination. In the future, this could be explored 
using variable distances per amenity.

I created a function `get_amenities(lat, lon)` to retrieve the amenities within walking distance of a point.

```python
MAX_WALK_TIME = 15

def get_amenities(lat, lon):
    payload = {
        "locations":[
            {"lat": lat,"lon": lon}
        ],
        "costing":"pedestrian",
        "denoise":"0.11",
        "generalize":"0",
        "contours":[{"time":MAX_WALK_TIME}],
        "polygons":True
    }


    request = f"http://localhost:8002/isochrone?json={json.dumps(payload)}"
    isochrone = requests.get(request).json()

    geom = json.dumps(isochrone['features'][0]['geometry'])

    query = f"""
    SELECT * FROM planet_osm_point
    WHERE ST_Contains(ST_Transform(ST_GeomFromGeoJSON('{geom}'),3857), way) AND (amenity IS NOT NULL OR shop IS NOT NULL OR leisure IS NOT NULL);
    """

    cur.execute(query)
    rows = cur.fetchall()

    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM planet_osm_point LIMIT 0")
    colnames = [desc[0] for desc in cur.description]
    
    return to_dict(colnames, rows)
```

This function:

1. makes a request to the Valhalla Isochrone service to get the polygon representing a 15 minute walk surrounding the point
2. uses that polygon to find all unique amenities within those bounds

The amenities considered here are represented in the following OSM tags, including their definitions from the OSM wiki.

* `amenity:cafe` - a generally informal place with sit-down facilities selling beverages and light meals and/or snacks
* `amenity:bar` - a purpose-built commercial establishment that sells alcoholic drinks to be consumed on the premises
* `amenity:pub` - an establishment that sells alcoholic drinks that can be consumed on the premises
* `amenity:restaurant` - formal eating places with sit-down facilities selling full meals served by waiters
* `shop:bakery` - a shop selling bread
* `shop:convenience` - a small local shop carrying a variety of everyday products, mostly including single-serving food items
* `shop:supermarket` - a large shop for groceries and other goods, including meat and fresh produce
* `shop:department_store` - a large store with multiple clothing and other general merchandise departments
* `shop:clothes` - a shop which primarily sells clothing, such as underwear, shirts, jeans etc
* `shop:shoes` - is a type of retailer that specialises in selling shoes
* `shop:books` - A shop selling books (including antique books, chain bookstores, etc.)
* `shop:hairdresser` - where you can get your hair cut
* `leisure:fitness_center` - a place with exercise machines and/or fitness/dance classes. They are places to go to for exercise
* `leisure:park` - an area of open space for recreational use, usually designed and in semi-natural state with grassy areas, trees and bushes

I also compared these rankings to Walk Score, and found that they seemed to be mostly in the ballpark.

![walk score comparison](/isochrone-walkability/walk-score-comparison.png)

This plot shows the difference between the Walk Score ranking and my ranking. E.g. I ranked San Fransisco as #26, but Walk Score ranked it at #1, showing a 
bar at -25 for the first entry. The x axis is ordered by the walk score ranking.[^walk-score-rankings]

### Limitations

Some significant limitations: 
* I didn't filter samples that aren't on land
* I didn't filter for residential areas (although arguably this could be intentional to count tourism and travel)
* openstreetmap is made by crowdsourced data from volunteers, and amenity data may not be evenly distributed (probably benefitting higher population cities)
* Biases from the boundaries of the city vs. metropolitan sprawl. This would be biased toward larger metropolitan areas

### Performance

I profiled running this on a single city with flameprof[^flameprof], and found that the majority of time is spent between querying Valhalla and querying PostGIS,
which makes sense to me. Both Valhalla and PostGIS are most likely heavily optimized already, so the only way I could shave down runtime would be to sample fewer points.

![flame graph](/isochrone-walkability/flame-graph.svg)

## Future Work

### Custom walkability scores

Explore customized walkability scores. "Walkability" based on *all* amenities is painting with a broad brush. Most people probably don't care about every single 
amenity that can be categorized. Peter Johnson has an interesting article[^reverse-engineering-walkscore]
about reverse engineering the Walk Score, which found that it's highly correlated with the number of nearby restaurants.

Personally, I love restaurants, but I cook most of my meals at home, so this score may be less useful to me. I like the idea of assigning
weights to each amenity to get a more custom optimization. You could even optimize for something like "most walkable Chinese restaurants" or "most parts".

We could also codify some other factors with walkability related to the isochrone calculations. For example, people with disabilities may have
an especially hard time with poor sidewalk infrastructure. I don't think Valhalla supports custom sidewalk cost penalties related to width, sidewalk condition,
or curb cuts, but I would be interested in exploring that more specifically. 

One of the coolest things about openstreetmap is the level of detail available in the data. I don't know of anywhere else where curb cut data is available.

### Amenity centered isochrones

Another idea I had was instead of sampling a bunch of points, which requires a lot of isochrone calculations, instead calculate isochrones starting from each amenity.
Then we could combine all the isochrone polygons and calculate what portion of the city is within X minute walk of that amenity. This could also be useful for finding
amenity "deserts", like food deserts, but more general.

This would also allow me to explore varying the walking distance for each amenity category. E.g. I would be more willing to walk further for infrequent and important
errands, like electronics repair or a hospital visit. But for more common tasks like getting groceries, I would prefer a closer walk.
