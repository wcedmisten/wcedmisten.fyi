# About

I'm William Edmisten, a software engineer working 
for Reify Health. I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2019
with a BS in Computer Science.

I like starting hobby projects, and I'm hoping this blog
will give me more accountability to complete them. I also
hope to document my progress in a way that might be helpful
for others.
