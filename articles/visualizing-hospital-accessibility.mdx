## Rural Hospital Accessibility

Rural Americans face many challenges accessing medical care.
Hospitals and other medical facilities tend to cluster in denser population areas,
leaving residents of rural areas without nearby access to medical care, especially 
for specialty medicine. Rural facilities may struggle to stay funded due to lack
of patient population.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services,
65.83% of designated Health Professional Shortage Areas are rural. [^ rural-shortages] [^ rural-health-info]

![Map of Health Professional Shortage Areas](/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/hpsa-primary-care.jpg)

Increased distance to a hospital during a medical emergency also increases mortality rates.
A 2007 study found that a 10km increase in distance to the hospital 
during an emergency resulted in a 1% increase in mortality. [^ hospital-study]

### Driving Distance Hospital Accessibility

For this project, I wanted to see how much of my state was within a certain driving time 
of a hospital.
By calculating an Isochrones map [^ isochrones] in 10 minute increments, we can view the 
area around a hospital that is drivable within those time constraints.

## OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a crowd-sourced map dataset spanning the entire world.
For this project, I used the data in two ways:

1. finding a list of hospitals and their locations
2. finding the Isochrone map for each hospital

I used the OSM extract provided by GeoFabrik for the state of Virginia.

### Finding all hospitals in Virginia

To find all hospitals in OpenStreetMap, I searched for the tag 
`amenity=hospital`. This tag differs from `amenity=clinic` subtly.
The difference between a clinic and a hospital is not always obvious.
However, the main distinction is that a hospital offers inpatient
care, while a clinic does not.

To search the dataset, I first considered using the Overpass API [^ overpass-api],
but I two problems:
1. the size of my query was too big to use the free public instance (Overpass Turbo)
2. setting up the software to run locally seemed too complicated compared to just using PostGIS

So ultimately I decided to just use PostGIS, which was more familiar to me.

I used `osm2pgsql` to import the data, and then could easily query it using SQL.

To get all hospitals and their names and locations, only two simple queries were required:

```sql
SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Transform(way,4326)) as centroid,osm_id,name
FROM planet_osm_point
WHERE amenity='hospital';
```

To get all hospitals that were tagged as points, and:

```sql
SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Transform(ST_Centroid(way),4326)) AS centroid, osm_id, name
FROM planet_osm_polygon
WHERE amenity='hospital';
```

To get all hospitals that were tagged as polygons.
For my purpose I wanted a point to represent each hospital, so I just calculated the 
centroid of each polygon with the `ST_Centroid` function.
In both cases I also projected the data into EPSG:4326.

### Isochrones 

Once I had this list of hospitals and their locations, I needed to find the 
area representing maximum travel time around each of them. For this,
I used set up Valhalla's Isochrones API on the OSM extract.
This API uses the road structure and speed limits (tagged or estimated) to determine the boundary 
that can be travelled within a given time.

The API also allows multiple time boundaries to be specified at once,
reducing the number of API calls required.
The following payload was used to request the isochrone for each hospital.
Here we provide the coordinates of each hospital and specify that we want 
isocrhones provided for 10, 20, 30, and 40 minute boundaries.

The API returns a geoJSON polygon for each contour.

```python
name = record["name"]
lon = record["lon"]
lat = record["lat"]

payload = {
    "locations":[
        {"lat": lat,"lon": lon}
    ],
    "costing":"auto",
    "denoise":"0.5",
    "generalize":"0",
    "contours":[{"time":10},{"time":20},{"time":30},{"time":40}],
    "polygons":True
}

request = f"http://localhost:8002/isochrone?json={json.dumps(payload)}"
isochrone = requests.get(request).json()
```

After calculating the polygons for each hospital, I found the union of 
all polygons at each contour level.
This meant that overlapping polygons of the same level were joined together.

Let's dive into a result showing two hospitals in Virginia.
The two lime green splotches around each hospital represent the area that 
is within a 10 minute drive of either hospital.
The turquoise boundary indicates the area where the drive time would be 
between 10-20 minutes.
The purple boundary represents 20-30 minutes, and the pink boundary represents 30-40 minutes.
White represents a drive of at least 40 minutes to a hospital.

![Isochrones Map of Two Hospitals in Central Virginia](/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/hospital-isochrones.png)

This can be displayed for the entire state:

![Isochrones Map of Two Hospitals in Central Virginia](/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/virginia-isochrones-big.png)

Even at a high level, we can see where in the state has varying options for hospital acccessibility.
Generally, hospitals cluster around cities, which can also be seen here.
Northern VA has a lot of green, so does Richmond, as well as the Norfolk and VA Beach areas.
Areas of white (indicating low access to hospitals) are mostly in central and southwest VA.

## Population Analysis

Although it's clear many places in Virginia are far from hospitals (plenty of white on the map),
I was curious what percent of residence this distribution actually affects.
Since most Americans live in cities, perhaps these areas are mostly unpopulated.

To answer this question, I turned to a dataset provided by the European Union:
The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHS) Population dataset [^ GHS-POP].
This dataset provides an estimate of population distribution across the entire globe.
The dataset is formatted as an image of 100m x 100m squares, each containing the 
estimated population residing in each square.

The following image shows the raw data provided in an extract of this dataset.
The brighter colors indicate higher population, so the image here shows 
cities along the coastline. However due to the unconventional projection used
(Mollweide [^ Mollweide]), the image appears slanted and skewed compared to 
a more traditional projection. The missing chunk in the bottom right
corner is the Atlantic Ocean.

![GHS Population Image Visualized](/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/GHS-POP.png)

### Rasterstats

The Python library rasterstats [^ rasterstats] was created to calculate statistics 
over geospatial raster image datasets like GHS-POP.
By supplying a polygon and the image file, the library will calculate various statistics 
about the data contained in that polygon.

Since the dataset is in Mollweide and my polygons are in EPSG:4326,
I had to transform the polygons into Mollweide before using them.

```python
def estimate_population(dataset, geom):
  polygon = shape(geom)

  project_to_mollweide = pyproj.Transformer.from_proj(
          pyproj.Proj('epsg:4326'), # source coordinate system
          pyproj.Proj('esri:54009'),
          always_xy=True
  )

  projected = transform(project_to_mollweide.transform, polygon)

  window = geometry_window(dataset, [projected], pad_x=10, pad_y=10)

  dataset.read(masked=True, window=window)[0]

  zs = zonal_stats(projected, GHS_POP_FILENAME, stats="sum")
  return round(zs[0]["sum"])
```

To sanity check my approach of estimating population, I used the boundaries of Washington DC
and compared the result to the official census record.

```python
with open("dc.json", "r") as f:
   dc_geom = json.load(f)

print(estimate_population(dataset, dc_geom))
```

This outputs: 

```
707662
```

Compared to the official 2020 census estimate [^ census-dc-estimate] of 712,816, this is off by less than 1%.
Not bad!

### Population Estimates on Hospital Isochrones 

In my case, I just needed to sum all the values inside the polygon to get the total population.
I just supplied each multipolygon of joined contours at each level
(10 mins, 20 mins, 30 mins, and 40 mins), and the library calculated the population
within each one.

Another consideration was that I needed to intersect the Virginia state boundary with 
the Isochrones that were calculated. This is due to an artifact of how OSM extracts work.
When OSM extracts get made, they do not cut off existing features exactly at state 
boundaries. So our dataset includes roads in bordering states, which means our 
isochrones will leak into these states as well.

If we allowed this leakage to happen, our population estimates would include some
residents from neighboring states, causing a misleading statistic when calculating the percentage.

![GHS Population Image Visualized](/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/isochrone-overflow.png)

However, using `shapely`, we can calculate the intersection of the VA boundary against the 
isochrones to remove any residents from other states.

When intersected, we can see that the boundaries no longer leak into other states.

![GHS Population Image Visualized](/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/isochrone-cut-off.png)

```python
with open("states.json", "r") as f:
    states = json.load(f)

virginia = states["features"][46]
va_geom = shape(virginia["geometry"])
in_va = estimate_population(dataset, va_geom)

print(f"Estimated population of Virginia: {in_va}")

times = [40, 30, 20, 10]

for i in range(4):
  with open(f"polygon_{i}.json", "r") as f:
      iso_geom = shape(json.load(f))

  # intersection is needed to cut off isochrones that extend beyond VA borders
  # this is because the OSM extract includes roads that don't
  # get cut strictly at the border, but extend into other states
  # we don't want to include those populations in the numerator
  iso_va_intersection = va_geom.intersection(iso_geom)

  near_hospitals = estimate_population(dataset, iso_va_intersection)

  print(f"Estimated {near_hospitals} residents within {times[i]} mins of a hospital.")
  print(f"{near_hospitals / in_va * 100} percent of Virginia residents")
  print()
```

When reformatted into a table for readability:

Total Estimated VA Population: 8,433,266

| Travel Time (mins)  | Population |           VA Pop. (%) | VA Area. (%) |
| ------------------  | ---------- | --------------------: |-------------:|
| 10                  | 5,514,068  | 65.38                 | 9.11         |
| 20                  | 7,454,683  | 88.40                 | 31.68        |
| 30                  | 8,094,637  | 95.98                 | 59.29        |
| 40                  | 8,343,513  | 98.94                 | 80.44        |

## Conclusions

These results are kind of surprising! From the map, it's not obvious that
99% of Virginia residents are within 40 minutes of a hospital, because there
is a lot of white space on the map.
It's also interesting that 65% of the population lives in 9% of the area
that's within 10 minutes of a hospital.

Another interesting conclusion is that only 1% of the VA population lives 
in the remaining 20% of Virginia that is 40+ minutes from a hospital.

On the other hand, looking at distance to the nearest hospital is only 
one piece of the puzzle. This metric by itself is a bit optimistic,
because it does not account for specialty medicine that may not 
be available at the nearest hospital, despite one being near.

The data here is also crowd-sourced, and may not be 100% accurate or up to date.

I went through the data and found some places where hospitals were tagged incorrectly.
In many cases, clinics were being tagged as hospitals. I also found some 
"veterinary hospitals" tagged as hospitals and fixed these occurrences.

In my [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/121w4f8/oc_map_of_hospital_accessibility_by_car_in/)
on /r/dataisbeautiful, some users pointed out other inaccuracies.
I fixed the data where posssible in OpenStreetMap, but other errors may still exist.

If you see any, feel free to point them my way, or fix them yourself on OpenStreetMap.

## Creating the Interactive Map

The coolest part of this project was that the interactive map was entirely 
self-hosted on my own DigitalOcean droplet. The files are even small 
enough to fit into version control without issues. 
This approach will be incredibly useful for independent GIS enthusiasts
who can cut cost and don't need any Map API subscriptions to create
very powerful map experiences.

TODO: fill in how I made these maps!
